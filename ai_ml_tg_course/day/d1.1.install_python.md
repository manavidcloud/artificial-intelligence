Step 1: Install Python on Windows 11
Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Download the latest stable Python installer for Windows (e.g., Python 3.x.x).

Run the installer.

During installation, check the box "Add Python to PATH" at the bottom of the installer window.

Choose "Install Now" or "Customize Installation" if advanced options are needed.

After installation, open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:

text
python --version
to verify Python is installed correctly.

Step 2: Install Jupyter Notebook
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

Install Jupyter Notebook using pip:

text
pip install notebook
Once installed, you can start Jupyter Notebook by running:

text
jupyter notebook
This will open a new tab in your default web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.

Optional: Install JupyterLab (Modern Interface)
To install and run JupyterLab instead of classic notebook:

text
pip install jupyterlab
jupyter lab
Tips
To stop Jupyter Notebook, go to the Command Prompt window running it and press Ctrl + C.

Ensure your Windows Firewall allows the Jupyter port (usually 8888).

Use Anaconda if you prefer an all-in-one installer that bundles Python, Jupyter, and many libraries.

This method is straightforward and works well for Windows 11 users setting up a Python development environment with Jupyter Notebook.
