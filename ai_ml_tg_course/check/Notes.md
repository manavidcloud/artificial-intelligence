---

## Nested Functions

We can declare a function inside another function. Such functions are called **nested functions**.

### Example 1
```python
def outer():  # 1. Define outer function
    print('Outer Function started')  # 2. Print from outer

    def inner():  # 3. Define inner function
        print('Inner Function execution')

    print('Outer Function calling Inner Function')
    inner()  # Call inner function

outer()  # Call outer function
````

**Output:**

```
Outer Function started
Outer Function calling Inner Function
Inner Function execution
```

---

### Example 2: Calling Inner Function Before Print

```python
def outer():
    print('Outer function started')
    def inner():
        print('Inner function started')
    inner()
    print('Outer function calling Inner function')

outer()
```

---

### Example 3: Return Inner Function

```python
def outer():
    print('Outer function started')
    def inner():
        print('Inner function started')
    print('Outer function calling Inner function')
    return inner

fun_1 = outer()  # only runs outer()
fun_1()          # now runs inner()
```

* **Explanation:**

  * `outer()` prints outer messages and returns reference to `inner`.
  * `fun_1()` executes the returned `inner()`.

---

## Function Decorators

* A **decorator** is a function which takes another function as argument, **extends its functionality**, and returns the modified function.

📌 **Example analogy:**
We have a room (ordinary function).
A decorator is like a decorator person who enhances the room.
The room remains, but its appearance improves.

---

### Example 1: Without `@decorator`

```python
def ordinary():
    print('I am an ordinary function.....')

def makemepretty(func):  # decorator
    def inner_func():
        print('Now I am pretty')
        func()
    return inner_func()

# Apply decorator manually
pretty = makemepretty(ordinary)
```

---

### Example 2: With `@decorator`

```python
def makemepretty(func):
    def inner_func():
        print('Now I am pretty')
        func()
    return inner_func

@makemepretty
def NewOrdinary():
    print('I live in Nanded \n', 'Development needed here')
```

**Output:**

```
Now I am pretty
I live in Nanded 
Development needed here
```

---

## Exception Handling

In any programming language, two types of errors are possible:

1. **Compile-time or Syntax errors**
2. **Runtime errors** (exceptions)

An **exception** is:

* An unwanted/unexpected event that disturbs normal flow of program.
* Example: `ZeroDivisionError`, `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `EOFError`, etc.

---

### Without Handling

```python
a = int(input('Enter any number : '))
b = int(input('Enter any number : '))
c = a / b
```

If `b = 0`, we get:

```
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

---

### With `try-except`

```python
c = 0
try:
    a = int(input('Enter any number : '))
    b = int(input('Enter any number : '))
    c = a / b
except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError) as msg:
    print('Exception Occurred:', msg)

print('Value of c :', c)
print('Thank you')
```

**Output Example:**

```
Enter any number : 10
Enter any number : 0
Exception Occurred : division by zero
Value of c : 0
Thank you
```

---

### Generic `Exception`

```python
c = 0
try:
    a = int(input('Enter any number : '))
    b = int(input('Enter any number : '))
    c = a / b
except Exception as msg:  # catches all exceptions
    print('Exception Occurred:', msg)

print('Value of c :', c)
print('Thank you')
```

---

## Finally Block

* Always executes cleanup code whether exception occurs or not.
* Example: closing files, releasing resources, etc.

```python
c = 0
try:
    a = int(input('Enter any number : '))
    b = int(input('Enter any number : '))
    c = a / b
except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError) as msg:
    print('Exception Occurred:', msg)
finally:
    print('Finally Block : Cleanup Code')

print('Value of c :', c)
print('Thank you ')
```

**Output:**

```
Enter any number : 10
Enter any number : 20
Finally Block : Cleanup Code
Value of c : 0.5
Thank you
```

---

## Else Block with Try-Except-Finally

* `else` runs **only if no exception occurs** in the try block.
* `finally` runs always.

```python
c = 0
try:
    a = int(input('Enter any number : '))
    b = int(input('Enter any number : '))
    c = a / b
except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError) as msg:
    print('Exception Occurred:', msg)
else:
    print('Value of c :', c)
finally:
    print('Finally Block : Cleanup Code')

print('Thank you ')
```

**Output:**

```
Enter any number : 10
Enter any number : 20
Value of c : 0.5
Finally Block : Cleanup Code
Thank you
```

---

## User-Defined Exception

Also known as **customized/programmatic exceptions**.
Programmers define and raise them explicitly when needed.

```python
class MyException(Exception):  # must inherit from Exception
    def __init__(self, *args):
        self.msg = args

try:
    temp = int(input("Enter Temperature: "))
    if temp < 20:
        raise MyException("Low Temperature")
    print('Temperature is:', temp)
except MyException as msg:
    print("Error:", msg)

print('Thank you ')
```

**Output:**

```
Enter Temperature: 15
Error: ('Low Temperature',)
Thank you
```

📌 Note: `raise` is best for customized exceptions, but not for predefined ones.

# Day 4: AI - 28th Sept - 2025 - Regular expression

### Regular Expressions

If a group of strings needs to be represented according to a particular format or pattern, Regular Expressions should be used.

A Regular Expression is a declarative mechanism to describe a group of strings that follow a particular format/pattern.

**Examples:**  
- We can write a regular expression to represent all mobile numbers.  
- We can write a regular expression to represent all email IDs.

**Main application areas of Regular Expressions:**  
1. Developing validation frameworks/validation logic.  
2. Developing pattern matching applications (e.g., ctrl+F in Windows, grep in Unix).  
3. Building translators such as compilers and interpreters.  
4. Creating digital circuits.  
5. Developing communication protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, etc.), such as matching IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.101).

Regular Expression-based applications can be developed in Python using the `re` module.

This module provides several built-in functions for using Regular Expressions easily in applications.

#### 1. `compile()`  
- The `re` module provides the `compile()` function, which compiles a pattern into a RegexObject.

#### 2. `finditer()`  
- Returns an iterator that yields Match objects for every match found.

**Example:**  
```python
matcher = pattern.finditer("abaabababa")
```

For the Match object, the following methods can be called:  
- `start()` returns the starting index of the match.  
- `end()` returns the end (index + 1) of the match.  

***  

#### group()  
- `group()` returns the matched string.  

***  

### Example  

```python
import re
count = 0

pattern = re.compile("ab")
matcher = pattern.finditer("abaabababa")

for match in matcher:
    count += 1
    print(match.start(), match.end(), match.group())

print('The number of occurrences:', count)
```

**Output:**  
```
0 2 ab
3 5 ab
5 7 ab
The number of occurrences: 3
```

***  

### Character Classes

Character classes let us search for a group of characters:

| Expression      | Meaning                                          |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [abc]           | Either 'a', 'b', or 'c'                         |
| [^abc]          | Except 'a', 'b', and 'c'                        |
| [a-z]           | Any lowercase alphabet symbol                    |
| [A-Z]           | Any uppercase alphabet symbol                    |
| [0-9]           | Any digit from 0–9                               |
| [a-zA-Z]        | Any alphabetic symbol                            |
| [a-zA-Z0-9]     | Any alphanumeric character                       |
| [^a-zA-Z0-9]    | Except alphanumeric characters (special chars) |  

***  

### Example: Using Character Classes in Regular Expressions  

```python
import re

print('---------------------------------------------')
x = "[abc]"
print('Character Class :', x)

matcher = re.finditer(x, "a7b@k9z")
for match in matcher:
    print(match.start(), '-------', match.group())

print('---------------------------------------------')
x = "[^abc]"
print('Character Class :', x)

matcher = re.finditer(x, "a7b@k9z")
for match in matcher:
    print(match.start(), '-------', match.group())

print('---------------------------------------------')
x = "[a-z]"
print('Character Class :', x)

matcher = re.finditer(x, "a7b@k9z")
for match in matcher:
    print(match.start(), '-------', match.group())
```

***  

### Pre-defined Character Classes  

| Expression   | Description                                                               |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `\s`         | Space character                                                           |
| `\S`         | Any character **except** space character                                  |
| `\d`         | Any digit (**0–9**), e.g., `[0-9]`                                        |
| `\D`         | Any character **except** digit, e.g., `[^0-9]`                            |
| `\w`         | Any word character (alphanumeric + underscore), e.g., `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`      |
| `\W`         | Any character **except** word character (special characters)              |
| `.`          | Any character, including special characters                               |  

***  

### Example  

```python
import re

print('---------------------------------------------')
x = "\s"
print('Pre-defined Character Class :', x)
matcher = re.finditer(x, "a7b k@9z")
for match in matcher:
    print(match.start(), '-------', match.group())

print('---------------------------------------------')
x = "\S"
print('Pre-defined Character Class :', x)
matcher = re.finditer(x, "a7b k@9z")
for match in matcher:
    print(match.start(), '-------', match.group())

print('---------------------------------------------')
x = "\d"
print('Pre-defined Character Class :', x)
matcher = re.finditer(x, "a7b k@9z")
for match in matcher:
    print(match.start(), '-------', match.group())
```

***  

### Quantifiers  

Quantifiers specify how many times a character or group should be matched:

| Pattern  | Meaning                                |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| `a`      | Exactly one 'a'                       |
| `a+`     | At least one 'a'                      |
| `a*`     | Any number of 'a's including zero     |
| `a?`     | At most one 'a' (zero or one)         |
| `a{m}`   | Exactly m number of 'a's              |
| `a{m,n}` | Minimum m and maximum n number of 'a's|  

**Special note:**  
- `^` checks if the string starts with the given pattern.  
- `$` checks if the string ends with the given pattern.  

***  

### Examples  

```python
import re

print('---------------------------------------------')
x = "a+"
print('Quantifier pattern:', x)
matcher = re.finditer(x, "abaaaaab")
for match in matcher:
    print(match.start(), '-------', match.group())

print('---------------------------------------------')
x = "a*"
print('Quantifier pattern:', x)
matcher = re.finditer(x, "abaaaab")
for match in matcher:
    print(match.start(), '-------', match.group())
```

### Important Functions of the `re` Module

1. `match()`  
2. `fullmatch()`  
3. `search()`  
4. `findall()`  
5. `finditer()` – Returns an iterator yielding Match objects for every match  
6. `sub()`  
7. `subn()`  
8. `split()`  
9. `compile()` – Compiles a pattern into a RegexObject

#### Example: Using `match()` function

```python
import re
str1 = 'ababcabdefg'
s1 = input("Enter Pattern to check: ")
m = re.match(s1, str1)

if m is None:
    print('Match is not available at the beginning of the string.')
else:
    print('Match is available at the beginning of the string.')
```

This code checks whether the pattern exists **at the beginning** of `str1`. If the match is not found, it notifies the user.

***

### 2. `fullmatch()`

- Matches the entire target string against a pattern.
- Returns a Match object if full string matches, else None.

```python
import re

str1 = 'abcd'
s = input("Enter Pattern to check: ")
m = re.fullmatch(s, str1)

if m is not None:
    print('FullMatch is available for the string.')
else:
    print('FullMatch is not available for the string.')
```

***

### 3. `search()`  

- Searches the given pattern anywhere in the string.
- Returns the first Match object if found, else None.

```python
import re

str1 = 'abcabdefg'
s = input("Enter Pattern to check: ")
m = re.search(s, str1)

if m is not None:
    print('First occurrence start index:', m.start(), 'End index:', m.end())
else:
    print('Match not found in the string.')
```

***

### 4. `findall()`  

- Returns a list of all matches found (non-overlapping).

```python
import re

msg = "Python is an easy programming language. Python is good lang"
s1 = input('Enter Search Word: ')

matches = re.findall(s1, msg)
print(matches)
```

Example input `"Python"` outputs:  
```
['Python', 'Python']
```

***

### 5. `findall()` Example to Find Digits

```python
import re

digits = re.findall(r'[0-9]', 'a7b9c5kz')
print(digits)
```

Output:  
```
['7', '9', '5']
```

***

### 6. `sub()` (Substitution)

- Replaces every matched pattern with the specified replacement.

```python
import re

result = re.sub(r'[a-z]', '#', 'a7b9c5kz')
print(result)
```

Output:  
```
#7#9#5#8#
```

***

### 6. `sub()` Example – Interactive Replacement

```python
msg = 'Python is an easy programming language. Python is good language'
import re

s1 = input('Enter Search Word: ')
s2 = input('Enter New Word: ')

result = re.sub(s1, s2, msg)
print(result)
```

***

### 7. `subn()`

- Like `sub()`, but also returns the number of replacements as a tuple.

```python
import re

t = re.subn('[a-z]', '#', 'a7b9c5k8z')
print(t)
print('Result string:', t[0])
print('Number of replacements:', t[1])
```

Output:  
```
('#7#9#5#8#', 5)
Result string: #7#9#5#8#
Number of replacements: 5
```

***

### 1. Regular Expression for 10-digit Mobile Numbers

Rules:  
- Exactly 10 digits.  
- First digit is 7, 8, or 9.

Patterns:  
```python
[7-9][0-9]{9}
# or
(7|8|9)\d{9}
```

***

### 2. Check if String Starts with “r” and Ends with “h”

```python
import re

pattern = r'^r.*h$'
result = re.match(pattern, "rakesh")
print(result is not None)  # True for "rakesh"
```

***

### 3. Valid Email Address Check

```python
import re

def is_valid_email(email):
    pattern = r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    return re.match(pattern, email) is not None

def main():
    email = input("Enter an email address: ")
    if is_valid_email(email):
        print("Valid email address")
    else:
        print("Invalid email address")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

***

### Extract Mobile Numbers and Email Addresses from File

```python
import re

file = open('Data.txt')
data = file.read()

pattern_mobile = r'[7-9]\d{9}'
mobile_numbers = re.findall(pattern_mobile, data)

pattern_email = r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
email_addresses = re.findall(pattern_email, data)

for m in mobile_numbers:
    print(m)
for e in email_addresses:
    print(e)
```

Continuing with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) content formatting:

***

### Python's Object Oriented Programming (OOP): What is a Class?

1. In Python, everything is an object. To create an object, a model or blueprint called a *class* is required.
2. A class represents properties (attributes) and actions (behavior) of objects. For example, `lst.append(40)` uses a method on a list object.
3. Properties are represented by variables.
4. Actions are represented by methods.
5. Therefore, a class contains both variables and methods.

**Example analogy:**  
- Earlier, we prepared food at home.  
- Now, we go out and get food.   
- Similarly, earlier we assembled laptops at home; now, we assemble laptops in the market.

***

### Terminology Example

- Objects like tables, chairs, and mobiles belong to classes such as Furniture and Electronics.
- Furniture class has objects like chairs and tables.
- Mobile class has objects like specific mobile phones.

***

### How to Define a Class

A class is defined using the `class` keyword.

**Syntax:**

```python
class ClassName:
    '''Documentation string'''
    # Variables: instance variables, static variables, local variables
    # Methods: instance methods, static methods, class methods
```

- The documentation string describes the class; it's optional but recommended for clarity.

***

### Accessing Docstring of a Class

```python
print(ClassName.__doc__)
help(ClassName)
```

Example:

```python
list.__doc__
str.__doc__
tuple.__doc__
```

***

### Types of Variables in Python Classes

1. **Instance Variables:** Object-level, unique per instance.  
2. **Static Variables:** Class-level, shared among all instances.  
3. **Local Variables:** Method-level, accessible only within methods.

***

### Types of Methods in Python Classes

1. **Instance Methods:** Operate on instance data.  
2. **Class Methods:** Operate on the class itself, marked with `@classmethod`.  
3. **Static Methods:** No reference to instance or class, marked with `@staticmethod`.

***

### What is an Object?
ex: steave job have one idea like for apple mobile which is in his mind, now he given the mobile or blueprint to users, here mobile is object.

- The physical existence of a class — an instance created from the class blueprint.  
- Any number of objects can be created from a class.

Syntax:

```python
reference_variable = ClassName()
# Example
s = Student()
```

***

### What is a Reference Variable?

- Reference variable refers to an object, allowing access to its properties and methods.

***

### The `self` Variable

- `self` refers to the current instance of the class, similar to `this` in other languages.  
- Used inside constructors (`__init__`) and instance methods to access instance variables and methods.

**Notes:**

1. `self` must be the first parameter in constructors and instance methods.  
2. Example method header:  
```python
def show(self):
    pass
```

***

### Constructor Concept in Python

1. A constructor is a special method `__init__` called automatically when an object is created.  
2. Its main purpose is initializing instance variables.  
3. Must take at least the `self` parameter.  
4. If not provided, Python supplies a default constructor.

Example:

```python
def __init__(self, name, rollno, marks):
    self.name = name
    self.rollno = rollno
    self.marks = marks
```

***

Continuing with formatted content including class examples:

***

## Example: Employee Class with Instance Variables and Methods

```python
class Employee:
    '''This is an example Employee class.'''
    
    def __init__(self, id, nm, sal):
        self.empID = id       # Instance variable
        self.name = nm
        self.salary = sal
    
    def show_empinfo(self):
        print('Employee ID:', self.empID)
        print('Employee Name:', self.name)
        print('Salary:', self.salary)
    
    def get_pf_da_info(self):
        print('PF:', self.salary * 0.10)
        print('DA:', self.salary * 0.15)
```

### Using the Employee Class and Objects

```python
emp1 = Employee(101, 'Navid', 50000)
emp2 = Employee(201, 'Ali', 90000)

print(id(emp1))
print(type(emp1))

emp1.show_empinfo()
emp2.show_empinfo()

emp1.get_pf_da_info()
```

**Explanation:**  
- `self` refers to the current object.  
- Each object `emp1`, `emp2` has its own data.

***

## Example: Bank Class with Static and Instance Variables

```python
class Bank:
    ifsc_code = 98212  # Static variable shared by all instances
    
    def __init__(self, an, nm, bal):
        self.accno = an      # Instance variables unique to each instance
        self.name = nm
        self.balance = bal

        print('Balance in the account:', self.balance)
        print('IFSC of your account:', self.ifsc_code)
```

### Using the Bank Class and Objects

```python
ac1 = Bank(1001, 'navid', 48592)
ac2 = Bank(1024, 'bob', 48291)
ac3 = Bank(1234, 'yogesh', 1482)

ac1.show_acc_info()
ac2.show_acc_info()
ac3.show_acc_info()

# Update the static variable for all accounts
Bank.ifsc_code = 2931

ac1.show_acc_info()
ac2.show_acc_info()
ac3.show_acc_info()

# Override static variable for an instance
ac1.ifsc_code = 200
ac1.show_acc_info()
```

## Setter and Getter Methods

We can set and get the values of instance variables by using getter and setter methods.

### Setter Method

Setter methods (also known as mutator methods) are used to set values to instance variables.

**Syntax:**

```python
def setVariable(self, variable):
    self.variable = variable
```

**Example:**

```python
def setRollno(self, rollno):
    self.rollno = rollno
```

---

### Getter Method

Getter methods (also known as accessor methods) are used to get values of instance variables.

**Syntax:**

```python
def getVariable(self):
    return self.variable
```

**Example:**

```python
def getName(self):
    return self.name
```

---

### Class Methods

Inside method implementation, if we are only using class variables (static variables), such type of methods should be declared as class methods.

Declare class method explicitly using `@classmethod` decorator. For class methods, the `cls` variable should be provided at the time of declaration.

Call class methods using class name or object reference.

---

## Example: Without Setter Method

```python
# without setter method
class Product:
    def __init__(self, id, na, co):
        self.p_id = id 
        self.name = na 
        self.cost = co 
    
    def show_product_info(self):
        print('Product ID  : ', self.p_id)
        print('Product Name  : ', self.name)
        print('Product Cost  : ', self.cost)

P1 = Product(101, 'Computer', 50483)
P1.show_product_info()           # This will print product info

P1.cost = 70000
P1.show_product_info()           # This will print product info

P1.cost = -40000
P1.show_product_info()           # This will print product info
```

---

## Example: With Setter Method

```python
# with setter method 
# after apply the setter method to class: set_cost() as to avoid negative value issue

class Product:
    def __init__(self, id, na, co):
        self.p_id = id 
        self.name = na 
        self.cost = co 
    
    def set_cost(self,new_cost):
        if new_cost >= 0:
            self.cost = new_cost
    
    def show_product_info(self):
        print('Product ID  : ', self.p_id)
        print('Product Name  : ', self.name)
        print('Product Cost  : ', self.cost)

# this is initital input 
P2 = Product(201, 'Mouse', 4000)
P2.show_product_info()           # This will print product info

# change the cost using the set
P2.cost = 70000
P1.show_product_info()           # This will print product info

P2.cost = -40000
P1.show_product_info()           # This will print product info
```

---

## Example: With Getter Method

```python
## with gettter method we only featch the values - to validate the class

# after apply the setter method to class: set_cost()

class Product:
    def __init__(self, id, na, co):
        self.p_id = id 
        self.name = na 
        self.cost = co 
    
    def set_cost(self,new_cost):
        if new_cost >= 0:
            self.cost = new_cost
        else:
            print('Eorr: Invalid cost. please provide postivie value')

    def get_cost(self):   # Getter Method
        return self.cost        
    
    def show_product_info(self):
        print('Product ID  : ', self.p_id)
        print('Product Name  : ', self.name)
        print('Product Cost  : ', self.cost)

# this is initital input 
P2 = Product(201, 'Mouse', 4000)
P2.show_product_info()           # This will print product info

# change the cost using the set
P2.set_cost(-70000)
P2.show_product_info()           # This will print product info

# get method
P2.cost = -40000
P2.show_product_info()           # This will print product info
```

---

## Example: Private Instance Variable

```python
## how to make private instanse variable

# after apply the setter method to class: set_cost()
class Product:
    def __init__(self, id, na, co):
        self.p_id = id 
        self.name = na 
        self._cost = co 
    
    def set_cost(self,new_cost):
        if new_cost >= 0:
            self.cost = new_cost
        else:
            print('Eorr: Invalid cost. please provide postivie value')

    def get_cost(self):   # Getter Method
        return self._cost        ## private method 
    
    def show_product_info(self):
        print('Product ID  : ', self.p_id)
        print('Product Name  : ', self.name)
        print('Product Cost  : ', self._cost)

# this is initital input 
P2 = Product(201, 'Mouse', 4000)
P2.show_product_info()           # This will print product info

# change the cost using the set
P2.set_cost(-70000)
P2.show_product_info()           # This will print product info

# get method
P2.cost = -40000
P2.show_product_info()           # This will print product info
```

## Properties in Python Class and Objects

In Python, properties in a class are a way to manage access to instance attributes (variables) by defining getter and setter methods.

This allows encapsulation of the internal data and control over how it's accessed or modified.

* you buy a watch and given to fritend direclty but its looks odd, so what you do you wrap it in gift wrap. this is same applicalbe as properties in class.
* by using cost name properties in the class example in the proogram

```python
class Product:
    def __init__(self, id, na, co):
        self.p_id = id 
        self.name = na 
        self._cost = co 
    
    def set_cost(self,new_cost):
        if new_cost >= 0:
            self.cost = new_cost
        else:
            print('Eorr: Invalid cost. please provide postivie value')

    def get_cost(self):   # Getter Method
        return self._cost        ## private method 
    
    def show_product_info(self):
        print('Product ID  : ', self.p_id)
        print('Product Name  : ', self.name)
        print('Product Cost  : ', self._cost)
        
    cost = property(get_cost,set_cost) # cost is properyty in product class

# this is initital input 
P3 = Product(201, 'Mouse', 4000)
P3.show_product_info()           # This will print product info

# with chaning one
P3.cost = 6000
P3.show_product_info()

# negative - it will fail due to setter method
P3.cost = -1000
P3.show_product_info()
```

---

## Property Decorator Method

```python
class Product:
    def __init__(self, id, nm, co):
        self.p_id = id
        self.name = nm
        self._cost = co   # Private Instance Variable...

    @property
    def cost(self):      # Getter Method
        return self._cost

    @cost.setter
    def cost(self, new_cost):   # Setter Method
        if new_cost >= 0:
            self._cost = new_cost
        else:
            print('Error : Invalid Cost. Please provide Positive Value...')

    def show_product_info(self):
        print('Product Id   :', self.p_id)
        print('Product Name :', self.name)
        print('Product Cost :', self._cost)
```

**Usage and Output:**

```python
P1 = Product(101, 'Computer', 50000)
P1.show_product_info()
```

```
Product Id   : 101
Product Name : Computer
Product Cost : 50000
```

```python
P1.cost = -1000
P1.show_product_info()
```

```
Error : Invalid Cost. Please provide Positive Value...
Product Id   : 101
Product Name : Computer
Product Cost : 50000
```

## Class Methods & Static Methods

```python
class Bank:
    ifsc_code = 1007   # Static Variable (Class Level Variable)

    def __init__(self, acno, name, bal):
        self.acno = acno
        self.name = name
        self.balance = bal

    def show_acc_info(self):
        print('Account No  :', self.acno)
        print('Name        :', self.name)
        print('Balance     :', self.balance)
        print('IFSC Code   :', self.ifsc_code)

    @classmethod # this is helping for validation and without @ - decorator we are making it to class method from instance method.
    def change_ifsc_code(cls, new_ifsc_code): # we define normal method of class, here cls defining the class so globally its from Bank class so it will change
        cls.ifsc_code = new_ifsc_code
        print('IFSC Code Changed Successfully.')

    @staticmethod
    def check_eligibility(age):
        if age >= 18:
            print('You are eligible to open account')
        else:
            print('You are minor. Please come with parents.')

    @staticmethod # this is like utility method
    def show_ifsc_code():
        print('IFSC Code  :', Bank.ifsc_code)

#
AC1 = Bank(101,'navid',9000)
AC2 = Bank(101,'ali',8000)
AC3 = Bank(101,'bob',7000)

AC1.show_acc_info()
AC2.show_acc_info()
AC3.show_acc_info()

Bank.ifsc_code = 5001 # this is not a good way to change the ifsc code without validation 
AC1.show_acc_info()
AC2.show_acc_info()
AC3.show_acc_info()

Bank.show_acc_info() # this will give an errror becuase its in an instansme method , can't be call by class name direclty

Bank.change_ifsc_code(7001)
AC2.show_acc_info()
AC3.show_acc_info()
```

---

### Static Method Explanation

static method: like bank this will care about employee or customer. but ther eis third party as well that either employee or customer like someone comes to fill the form or come for inquary. like such feature we can allowi using static method

* this allow to come in the bank but can't allow withdraw money
* this one have access to spedific location as well

```python
Bank.check_eligibility(20)
Bank.show_ifsc_code()
```

```
You are eligible to open account
IFSC Code  : 1007
```

## Polymorphism

Poly means many.
Morph means forms.

Polymorphism means 'Many Forms'.

Python is implicitly polymorphic.

---

### Eg1:

Yourself is best example of polymorphism. In front of Your parents You will have one type of behaviour and with friends another type of behaviour. Same person but different behaviours at different places, which is nothing but polymorphism.

---

### Eg2:

`+` operator acts as "concatenation" and "arithmetic addition"

---

### Eg3:

`*` operator acts as multiplication and repetition operator

---

### Eg4:

The same method with different implementations in Parent class and child classes (overriding).

```python
a = 10 + 20
print(a)

b = 'abc' + 'xyz'
print(b)

c = 10 * 2
print(c)

d = 'nanded' * 2
print(d)
```

---

## Related to Polymorphism

The following 3 topics are important:

1. Duck Typing Philosophy of Python
2. Overloading

   * Operator Overloading
   * Method Overloading: Unable to overload in python
   * Constractor overloading: unable to loverlod in python
3. Overridding

   * Method overridding
   * contrator overriding

---

## 1. Duck Typing Philosophy of Python

In Python we cannot specify the type explicitly. Based on provided value at runtime the type will be considered automatically. Hence Python is considered as Dynamically Typed Programming Language.

```python
def func1(obj):
    obj.talk()
```

What is the type of obj? We cannot decide at the beginning. At runtime we can pass any type. Then how can we decide the type?

At runtime if 'it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it must be duck'. Python follows this principle. This is called Duck Typing Philosophy of Python.

---

### Demo Program:

```python
class Duck:
    def talk(self):
        print('Quack.. Quack..')

class Dog:
    def talk(self):
        print('Bow Bow..')

class Cat:
    def talk(self):
        print('Moew Moew ..')

class Goat:
    def talk(self):
        print('Mee Mee ..')

def f1(obj):
    obj.talk()

lst = [Duck(), Cat(), Goat()]
for obj in lst:
    f1(obj)
```

ex: you want to go to college in that security guard

* student a comes then security guard ask for what you come student a told for class then he allow

* student b comes then security guard ask for what you come student b told for class then he allow

* same in pyton it will not going to chec spefici class or object its call duck phylosopy

---

## 2. Overloading

* Operator Overloading
* Method Overloading: Unable to overload in python
* Constractor overloading: unable to loverlod in python

---

### 1. Operator Overloading

We can use the same operator for multiple purposes, which is nothing but operator overloading.
Python supports operator overloading.

#### Eg1:

```python
print(10 + 20)      # 30
print('new' + 'delhi')  # newdelhi
```

#### Eg2:

```python
print(10 * 20)      # 200
print('delhi' * 3)  # delhidelhidelhi
```

### Demo Program to use `+` operator for our class objects

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, pages):
        self.pages = pages
```

---

### Program with Error

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self,pages):
        self.pages=pages

b1=Book(100)
b2=Book(200)

print(b1+b2)
```

**Output:**

```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Book' and 'Book'
```

---

### Fix with Operator Overloading

```python
# Demo program to overload + operator for our Book class objects:
class Book:
    def __init__(self, pages, name, cost):
        self.name = name
        self.pages = pages
        self.cost = cost

    def __add__(self, other):  # b1+b2 is calling to __add__ (magical method)
        return self.cost + other.cost

b1 = Book(100, 'C Programming', 500)
b2 = Book(200, 'Java', 700)

total_cost = b1.cost + b2.cost
print('Total No. of Pages ', b1 + b2) # b1+b2 - it also called dundle method
```

---

**Notes:**

* b1+b2 = + must have either integer number of 'a' + 'b' string
* so it will check if it have any dundle method define def `__add__` method
* self holding b1 as it inter method and first one.

`+` works with existing datatype but if it get user defined datatype → it checks `__add__`.

* ex: `b1+b2 = b1.__add__(b2)` → here b1=self and other=b2
* this works with two object only
* this also works with list and tuple
* with existing code its ignoring

---

### List of Magic Methods for Operators

```
+   ---> object.__add__(self, other)
-   ---> object.__sub__(self, other)
*   ---> object.__mul__(self, other)
/   ---> object.__div__(self, other)
//  ---> object.__floordiv__(self, other)
%   ---> object.__mod__(self, other)
**  ---> object.__pow__(self, other)
+=  ---> object.__iadd__(self, other)
-=  ---> object.__isub__(self, other)
*=  ---> object.__imul__(self, other)
/=  ---> object.__idiv__(self, other)
//= ---> object.__ifloordiv__(self, other)
%=  ---> object.__imod__(self, other)
**= ---> object.__ipow__(self, other)
<   ---> object.__lt__(self, other)
<=  ---> object.__le__(self, other)
>   ---> object.__gt__(self, other)
>=  ---> object.__ge__(self, other)
==  ---> object.__eq__(self, other)
!=  ---> object.__ne__(self, other)
```

### Program with Error

```python
b1=Book(100, 'C Programming, 500)
b2=Book(200, 'Java',700)
b3 = Book (300, 'Python',900)
total cost b1.cost+b2.cost print('Total No. of Pages ',b1+b2)
total cost b1 +62 +b3 print(total_cost)
```

**Output:**

```

Cell In[22], line 22
19 total cost = b1.cost+b2.cost

---> 22 total cost = b1b2+b3
23 print(total_cost)
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'Book'
```

---

### Fix

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, pages, name, cost):
        self.name = name
        self.pages = pages
        self.cost = cost

    def __add__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Book):
            return Book(self.pages + other.pages,
                        self.name + ' & ' + other.name,
                        self.cost + other.cost)
        return self.cost + other.cost  # This line may not work as intended if 'other' isn't a Book

b1 = Book(100, 'C Programming', 500)
b2 = Book(200, 'Java', 700)
b3 = Book(300, 'Python', 900)

# Adding cost directly works, but for chained addition, __add__ must return a Book object
total_cost = b1 + b2 + b3
print('Total No. of Pages:', total_cost.pages)
print('Total Cost:', total_cost.cost)

# If you want to print info about the combined object, add a __str__ method to Book
def __str__(self):
    return f"Total No. of Pages: {self.pages}\nTotal Cost: {self.cost}\nBooks: {self.name}"

Book.__str__ = __str__

print(total_cost)
```

---

### Same Program in Different Way

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, pages, name, cost): # constrative call. 
        self.name = name
        self.pages = pages
        self.cost = cost

    def __add__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Book):
            # return Book(self.pages + other.pages,
            #             self.name + ' & ' + other.name,
            #             self.cost + other.cost)
            return Book('','',self.cost + other.cost)            
        return self.cost + other.cost  # This line may not work as intended if 'other' isn't a Book

b1 = Book(100, 'C Programming', 500)
b2 = Book(200, 'Java', 700)
b3 = Book(300, 'Python', 900)

total_cost = b1 + b2

# print('Total No. of Pages:', total_cost.pages)
print('Total Cost:', total_cost.cost)

total_cost = b1 + b2 + b3
# this will used bodomust mass of math right to left b2+b3 (self,other as arugment) then its checkg if its boject using __add__ magical method
# once its solved or go return (return like which we mention self.cost + other cost this will contain the final value of b2+b3)
# later it will do like b1 + value which we got and perfrom the same to get the final value. 

# print('Total No. of Pages:', total_cost.pages)
print('Total Cost:', total_cost.cost)
```

## Method Overloading

* same name of function but different argument

ex:

1. define funct(a,b)
2. define fun(a,b,c)
3. define fun(a,b,c,d)

* same name with multiple forms.

* but in python this is not allow as python work on object base.

* hence funtion can refer later object only. method overloading not allowed.

Inheritance enables us to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows us to add more.

In this class, you will learn to use inheritance in Python.

Inheritance in Python is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming.

It refers to defining a new class with little or no modification to an existing class. The new class is called derived (or child) class and the one from which it inherits is called the base (or parent) class.

ex:

* one team was working but they left the organiszation
* now if you know the inheritance (like existing project) you can resume to work
* inhetircan : what we have we will use it as well as what is missing we will add this as well.
* we wiill create class in class.
