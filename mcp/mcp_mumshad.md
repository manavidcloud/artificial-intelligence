## Definition
An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is an interface that one application provides so that another application can interact with it.  
It defines **how software components should communicate with each other**.

---

## Example

Imagine you are on **Booking.com** checking flight details.  
Booking.com itself does not own flight data. Instead:  

- **Airline systems (like Emirates)** expose their flight information through **APIs**.  
- **Booking.com** calls those APIs to fetch real-time data (availability, timings, prices).  
- You see the results on Booking.com‚Äôs website/app, even though the source is Emirates‚Äô system.

So here:
- **Emirates** ‚Üí provides APIs (data source)  
- **Booking.com** ‚Üí consumes APIs (displays data to the user ‚Üí User Interface)  

---

## Analogy

Think of an **API** as a **restaurant waiter**:
- You (the customer/app) place an order (**request**).  
- The waiter (**API**) takes your request to the kitchen (**server/system**).  
- The kitchen prepares the dish (**data/service**).  
- The waiter brings it back to you (**response**).

## MCP Architecture

![MCP Architecutre](image.png)

### Tools
- Retrieve the information  
- Example:  
  ```bash
  curl https://www.joyair.com
``

* These details are shared with an **LLM (Large Language Model)** to make decisions.
* Based on the decision, the tool can make another API call (e.g., to **book the flight**).
* Each API call may differ, and each API response may differ.

üëâ Every airline has its own APIs. In AI, we cannot manually write integration code for each API.

This is where **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** comes in.

---

## What is MCP?

* **MCP = Model Context Protocol**
* Built by **Anthropic** and **open source** ‚Üí [GitHub repo](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
* Think of MCP as a **guide for APIs** that helps AI agents choose the right API and interact with third-party platforms.
* MCP provides **context** to agents so they can make the right API calls.

### Example: Flight MCP

MCP tells the agent that **JoyAir** has two capabilities:

* `searchFlights`
* `bookFlight`

The input/output schemas look like this:

```json
{
  "searchFlights": {
    "description": "Search flights from origin to destination on given date",
    "input_schema": {
      "origin": "string",
      "destination": "string",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"
    },
    "output_schema": {
      "flights": "List of flight objects with number"
    }
  },
  "bookFlight": {
    "description": "Book a flight for a passenger",
    "input_schema": {
      "flightNumber": "string",
      "passenger": {
        "firstName": "string",
        "lastName": "string",
        "email": "string"
      },
      "seatPreference": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## MCP Configuration

Every agent has an MCP configuration file (e.g., `mcp.json`) located in a defined path depending on the agent.

Example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MongoDB": {
      "command": "npx",  
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mongodb-mcp-server",
        "--connectionString",
        "mongodb://localhost:27017/myDatabase"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

* **MongoDB** ‚Üí Name of MCP
* **mongodb-mcp-server** ‚Üí Command & arguments associated with MongoDB
* **--connectionString** ‚Üí MongoDB connection string argument
* **mongodb://localhost:27017/myDatabase** ‚Üí Connection string to reach the database

üëâ This allows the agent to use the MCP server to **connect to a database**, **retrieve information**, and **modify data**.

---

## MCP Servers and Clients

* MCP servers work in a **client-server model**.
* Instead of interacting with APIs directly:

  * Each third-party service (like airlines) has its own **MCP server**.
  * The agent uses an **MCP client** to interact with those servers.

üí° This combination of **AI agents** (with memory, goal-driven behavior, and LLMs) + **MCP servers** enables agents to **discover third-party capabilities** and build powerful solutions.

---

## Example: Hotel Booking Agent

* Suppose we want an agent to **book hotels** in addition to booking flights.
* We would add more MCP servers.
* But adding too many responsibilities can **bloat the agent**.

üëâ Solution: **Specialized agents**.

* One agent for **airlines**
* Another agent for **hotels**
* Each with its own MCP integrations and memory of preferences.
* The airline agent can call the hotel agent ‚Üí this is known as **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication**.

# Agent-to-Agent Model (A2A)

* How does one agent know the capabilities of another?

* In what format can one agent pass information to another?

* This is where the **A2A model** comes in.

* **A2A** was developed by **Google**.

* Goal: Make it possible for agents to collaborate in a **dynamic multi-agent ecosystem**.

## How A2A Works

![A2A](image-2.png)

### Example

1. Flight agent ‚Üí asks hotel agent: *‚ÄúWhat can you do?‚Äù*
2. Hotel agent ‚Üí responds: *‚ÄúI can search and book hotels.‚Äù*
3. Flight agent ‚Üí assigns task: *‚ÄúSearch for the best hotels.‚Äù*
4. Hotel agent ‚Üí responds with results.

### Features of A2A

* Defines standards for **discovering capabilities** between agents.
* Defines standards for **assigning tasks** to other agents and checking status.
* Defines standards for **communication** between agents.
* Defines how **context and results** are shared back and forth.
